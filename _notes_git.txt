To get git:
	(next time just get it from http://msysgit.github.io/ )
	or: install github for windows, go to %localappdata%\GitHub\,
	copy PortableGit to E:\PortableGit, uninstall

To use git:
	cmd in code folder
		g
	where g.bat contains: E:\PortableGit\git-cmd.bat
	This opens a new cmd window.

Make sure to 'show hidden files & folders' as the .git folder is hidden.

To set notepad++ as the git core.editor:
	git config core.editor "'C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad\notepad++.exe' -multiInst -nosession -noPlugin"

#	In short, for a shell in the project folder with git available:
#		_cmd
#			g

git status gives warning about changing line endings from LF to CRLF:
	search and replace in Notepad++, or open each py file in Pycharm after checking project options
	(reason enough to not use Notepad on Windows: it doesn't recognise line endings other than CRLF -
	django's manage.py and git's commit generate LF-ending files)


Add to .gitignore:
    cmd:
        echo __pycache__>> .gitignore
    bash:
        echo "__pycache__" >> .gitignore


Copy from working dir to staging area:
	git add .

Remove a file from staging area:
    git rm --cached db.sqlite3

Copy from staging area to repo:
	git commit -m {summary}

Copy from working dir to repo (skip git add) - does not include brand new files:
	git commit -a

Concise log, with branching:
    git log --oneline --graph

Show changes between working dir and staging area:
	git diff

Show changes between staging area and repo:
	git diff --cached
or
	git diff --staged

Leave the diff display:
	q
or
	:q


Log commits specific to branch B (ie not found on master):
    git log master..B

Log commits that will be pushed:
    git log hub/master..HEAD

Squash last two commits:
    git rebase -i HEAD~2
    pick the older one (first on the list), squash the newer one.

Push local master branch to (a new) remote 'main' branch:
    git push hub master:main
